# Data structures and algorithms
## Objective
- This subject is	also	useful	for	Engineering	degree	students	and	Masters	degree	students	during their	academic	preparations.	In	all	the	chapters	you	will	see	that	there	is	more	emphasis	on problems	and	their	analysis	rather	than	on	theory.	In	each	chapter,	you	will	first	read	about	the basic	required	theory,	which	is	then	followed	by	a	section	on	problem	sets.
- Provide background knowledge of data structures and algorithms for Information technology students.
- Ability to select and solve information technology problems
